## About Me
I am currently a first-year undergraduate at UCL in the MEng Mathematical Computation (new name as Computer Science and Mathematics) programme. My major interests lie in the field of mathematical foundations of computing, machine learning and educational system design. I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into both proofs and codes. In my free time, I also like to study languages, explore societal topics and read books.

## Research Interests
Mathematical foundations of machine learning, AI model verification, safety & policy, Algorithm ethics, Game-theoretic modelling of learning system and educational fairness

## Publications
 - Pu, H. & Yi, K. (2024). “A Comparative Analysis of EfficientNet and MobileNet Models’ Performance on Limited Datasets: An Example of American Sign Language Alphabet Detection.” Highlights in Science, Engineering and Technology, 94, 558–564. DOI: 10.54097/yh5d3s04
   - Research Content: This paper compares the performance of two major light CNN architectures, EfficientNet and MobileNet, under the constraint of limited datasets. This experiment has used several datasets downloaded and merged from Kaggle, and has trained the models under 5, 10 and 20 epochs. The result has shown that MobileNet V2 outperforms other all other models in testing accuracy under 5 epochs, but all other models suffer from severe overfitting problem after 10 epochs.
   - Research Impact (as of Nov 30th, 2025): 8 citations recorded on Google Scholar, 496 publisher-page downloads within the first year of publication.

## Research Projects
 - American Sign Language Spelling Recognition System + Game - 2024
   - Final project of the research project "Introduction to Machine Learning and Neural Networks", led by Professor Rogers from University of Oxford.
   - This project has used a low-code machine-learning platform, EdgeImpulse, to build a machine-learning algorithm based on MobileNet V2 96x96 0.25 that can recognise the gesture of the basic alphabet gestures of American Sign Language. We have then deployed the model on a web application and created a game to help users learn and practice the gestures.
   - Achievement: Highest Grade Awarded Among All Groups in the Project
   - My Role: Model Training (with other Teammates), Frontend Construction & Model Deployment, Final Viva Presentation.

 - MVITA - Multi-Cultural Virtual Interview Agent, Hackathon Project - 2025
   - A project that helps the jobseekers who want to work overseas to prepare for the interview and adapting to other country's working culture through practising cultural-based interview scenario.
   - We have used Vue.js + Anam SDK as the frontend to achieve the user interface and the model's interaction with the user, as well as some logical implementations. We have also used Python as the backend to connect to ChatGPT's API to use GPT-5 model to generate interview questions based on cultural context and the user's CV. We have also used Flask as the backend to create a RESTful API to connect the frontend with the backend.
   - My Role: Frontend Construction & Anam SDK Connection. Prompt Engineering of the Question-Asking model and the Interviewer-Model.

## Roles, Teachings and Outreach
 - UCLCSSA (UCL Chinese Students and Scholar Association), Department of Chinese Education, Higher Level (高级班) Teacher @ UCL, 2025 - Now
   - In this course, I teach some advanced topics about Chinese Language Acquisition. In the lessons I am in charge of, I started off with some higher-level Chinese grammar and vocabulary, encouraging them to read longer, real-life passages in Chinese, along with some interactive activities encouraging them to learn about China and the Chinese culture. Then, we moved to Chinese Language and Literature, with the focus being on the book "Taipei People" (《台北人》). We explored reading and analysing Chinese literature texts and more about Chinese culture in its historical background, including the shared roots and cultural ties across the Taiwan Strait.
 - FutureUP ("笃行未来") - Founder & Curriculum Designer - 2025 - Now
   - FutureUP is a project aiming at Chinese Senior School & University students to help them develop their global vision, critical thinking skills, research skills and interdisciplinary capabilities to prepare them for becoming a talent in the future world amid China's transition from talent quantity to talent strength. I am the founder of this project. I am in charge of designing the course's overall architecture, and is focusing on developing the "General Knowledge" module in the curriculum. 
 - Dulwich College (Singapore) - HiMCM Coordinator and Mathematical Modelling Teaching Lead - 2024
   - In this course, I am in charge of coordinating the participation of HiMCM (The High School Mathematical Contests for Modelling) in DCSG. I have taught several techniques required for HiMCM such as AHP and TOPSIS, trying to stimulate their interest in Mathematical Modelling and Applied Mathematics, incorporating the teaching in understanding the underlying principles of how those models work, instead of simply teaching the models and let the students memorise.


## This coming summer (2026), my main focus will be on:
 - Modelling emotional dynamics of social media platforms, analysing the ethical impact of social algorithms and risk analysis (Using SIR)
 - The formal registration and start of FutureUP
